        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website is a portfolio / resume for an up and coming art student trying to make it in the illustration, animation, and design industry. He is skilled and proficient in multiple creation art forms: drawing and sketching, painting, sculpting, photography, graphic design, printmaking, ceramics, and art history and theory. His website will be a gallery of a few of his favorite works that display his different abilities and skills. The website will also be a means of contacting him to hire him for work on any projects or creations customers might have a need for.

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Tate Stephan. I am an illustrator currently studying at the Savannah College of Art of Design. A lot of my work is inspired by my interests and experiences outside of art, like popular entertainment and sports. I think that the main questions customers will have coming to the website will revolve around the artist and his experiences, his works, and how they can contact him. I think that the website will answer these questions mainly by showing customers through text and photos. Should customers have specific questions for the artist then they can contact him through his contact page.
